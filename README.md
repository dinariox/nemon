## Installation
To install nemon, simply download the newest installer .exe from the [releases page](https://github.com/dinariox/nemon/releases) and follow the instructions given by the installer. Nemon has an auto-updater built-in, so if I ever decide to publish updates it will be downloaded automatically the next time you start the application.
